# Working on the Expenses feature

This feature is fully colocated under `src/app/dashboard/expenses/`. Read
`CLAUDE.md` in this folder first — it explains the file map and the
Supabase-write → slice-update → audit-log data flow every mutation follows.

## Minimal file set for common changes

- **Add/change a field on an expense**: `_components/AddExpenseModal.tsx` (create
  form), `_components/EditExpenseModal.tsx` (edit form + before/after audit diff),
  `_store/expensesSlice.ts` only if the shape stored in Redux changes, and
  `src/types/index.ts` for the `Expense`/`ExpenseCategory` types. Also check
  `page.tsx` if the field needs to render in the table or be filterable
  (`lib/utils/filters.ts`).
- **Change list/filter/table behavior**: `page.tsx` only.
- **Change reducer logic**: `_store/expensesSlice.ts` + its test.

## Test command

`npx jest dashboard/expenses`

## Gotchas

- `expensesSlice` is registered centrally in `src/store/store.ts` and hydrated in
  `src/store/StoreProvider.tsx` — those two files import it via the
  `@/app/dashboard/expenses/_store/expensesSlice` alias. If you rename the slice
  file, update those imports too.
- `DeleteConfirmModal` and `InvoiceModal` are shared with Sales and Purchases
  (`src/components/modals/`) — modify them carefully, changes ripple to those
  features.
- Every create/update must call `writeAuditLog` + `dispatch(addAuditLog(...))` —
  the audit log is the compliance trail for this bookkeeping app, don't skip it.
